# port scanner in python 
To create a tool that scans a range of IP addresses and ports to identify which ports are open or closed on a target machine or network. This helps in understanding what services are running on the target machine.
A port is a communication endpoint through which network data is sent and received. Different applications use different ports to communicate (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443, SSH uses port 22). By scanning ports, you can identify which services are running on a target machine.
When scanning a target machine (or host), the goal is usually to gather information about the machine's open ports. These open ports indicate services or applications running on the machine, which might be accessible over a network. Understanding what ports are open and what services are running can help in a variety of legitimate use cases, as well as highlight potential risks or vulnerabilities.

Here are the main uses of identifying open ports on a target machine:

1. Network and Security Auditing:
Purpose: Scanning a target machine helps system administrators or security teams audit their own systems.
Benefit: Identifies unnecessary open ports and services that may expose the system to attack. Ensuring that only essential services are running and that the rest are properly secured can reduce the attack surface.
2. Vulnerability Detection:
Purpose: Open ports may correspond to services that have known vulnerabilities. Identifying these can help mitigate security risks.
Benefit: Helps security teams or penetration testers find and patch vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. For example, an old version of SSH or an unpatched web server may have critical security issues.
3. Penetration Testing:
Purpose: Ethical hackers or penetration testers scan open ports on a target machine to simulate attacks and assess the security posture.
Benefit: This helps identify potential entry points for attackers and provides opportunities to secure the system by closing unnecessary ports, updating software, or configuring firewalls.
4. Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:
Purpose: System administrators can use port scanning to diagnose network connectivity or service issues. If a service is expected to run on a particular port (e.g., a web server on port 80 or 443) and it's closed, there may be a configuration or firewall issue.
Benefit: It helps to quickly identify whether a service is properly running, blocked by a firewall, or misconfigured, and troubleshoot accordingly.
5. Load Balancing and Network Management:
Purpose: In a network with multiple servers, scanning open ports can help identify which servers are running specific services. It can also help ensure load balancing and redundancy across servers.
Benefit: It allows efficient use of resources by distributing traffic to the appropriate servers running critical services.
6. Service Discovery:
Purpose: For DevOps or IT teams, identifying which services are available on which machines is crucial, especially in large networks or cloud environments.
Benefit: It helps maintain an up-to-date map of the infrastructure, ensuring proper access control, service orchestration, and monitoring.
7. Firewall and Intrusion Detection Testing:
Purpose: By scanning a target machine, security teams can verify whether firewalls are correctly blocking unauthorized ports and detecting potential intrusions.
Benefit: Ensures that firewall rules are properly configured, blocking all unnecessary or potentially dangerous traffic while allowing necessary services to communicate.
8. System Configuration and Deployment Validation:
Purpose: After deploying a system, scanning can confirm that all necessary services are running and accessible, and that ports are correctly configured.
Benefit: Helps ensure smooth deployment by verifying that configurations match expectations, such as making sure a database is listening on the correct port.
